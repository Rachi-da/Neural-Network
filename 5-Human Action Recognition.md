This image shows a **Human Action Recognition (HAR)** dataset with **multiple action classes**‚Äîlike "Swipe Left", "Squat", "Boxing", "Catch", etc.

This is likely a visual dataset where each **sample is a sequence of video frames or keypoints (e.g., from pose estimation)** labeled with the corresponding action.

---

### üß† Goal

To build a neural network to **classify the action** being performed in a video or a frame sequence.

### ‚úÖ Steps to Apply Neural Network Classification on This Dataset

1. **Preprocessing**

   * Extract features from video frames (e.g., using:

     * Pose keypoints (OpenPose, MediaPipe)
     * Optical flow
     * CNN features from frames
     * Raw pixel data (not ideal unless small resolution)
   * Label encode the actions:
     `'Swipe Left' ‚Üí 0`, `'Swipe Right' ‚Üí 1`, etc.

2. **One-Hot Encoding of Labels**
   Convert integer labels to one-hot:

   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical
   y_onehot = to_categorical(y_integer_labels)
   ```

3. **Neural Network Model (PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras)**
   For example in PyTorch:

   ```python
   model = nn.Sequential(
       nn.Linear(input_size, 128),
       nn.ReLU(),
       nn.Linear(128, 64),
       nn.ReLU(),
       nn.Linear(64, num_classes)
   )
   ```

4. **Training**

   * Loss: `CrossEntropyLoss` (no need to apply softmax manually)
   * Optimizer: `Adam` or `SGD`

5. **Prediction**

   * Get logits ‚Üí `torch.argmax(output, dim=1)` to get class

---

### üîç Example Use Cases

* Train with pose sequences (each time step: 2D/3D body joint coordinates)
* Use CNN-RNN model for spatiotemporal recognition (CNN ‚Üí LSTM ‚Üí Classifier)
