Great question! Understanding the connection between a **neural network** and the **human brain** helps clarify why it's called a "neural" network in the first place.

## 🧠 Biological Brain vs. 🖥️ Artificial Neural Network

| **Biological Brain**                          | **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**                                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Contains billions of **neurons**              | Contains units called **artificial neurons (nodes)**                           |
| Neurons connect via **synapses**              | Neurons connect via **weights** between layers                                 |
| Neuron fires when signal passes a threshold   | Neuron activates when weighted sum passes through an **activation function**   |
| Learning occurs by adjusting synapse strength | Learning occurs by adjusting **weights** using algorithms like backpropagation |
| Signals are electrical and chemical           | Signals are **numerical values**                                               |

### 🔶 How Are They Similar?

1. **Neurons and Nodes**:

   * In the brain, a neuron receives signals from others and decides whether to "fire".
   * In a neural network, a node receives inputs, multiplies them by weights, adds a bias, and applies an activation function.

2. **Connections and Weights**:

   * The **strength of a synapse** in the brain affects how strong a signal is passed.
   * In ANNs, **weights** play the same role.

3. **Learning**:

   * Brains strengthen or weaken connections through experience.
   * ANNs learn by adjusting weights during training using data.

### 🔶 Visual Analogy

```
Biological Neuron:
   Dendrites → Cell Body → Axon → Synapse → Next Neuron

Artificial Neuron:
   Inputs → Weighted Sum + Bias → Activation Function → Output
```

### 🔶 Key Differences

* The **brain is massively parallel**, has high adaptability, and is energy-efficient.
* ANNs are **simplified mathematical models** — they mimic some **ideas**, not the full complexity of the brain.

### 🔶 Why Use the Term "Neural Network"?

Because:

* It **mimics the structure** of brain-like learning.
* It **learns from data** by adjusting internal "connections" (weights).
* It captures the **idea** of learning through trial, error, and adaptation — just like a brain does.
