Great! Let’s dive into **Activation Functions** — a key part of how neural networks “think.”

## 🔶 What Is an Activation Function?

An **activation function** decides whether a neuron should "fire" (i.e., pass information to the next layer).

It adds **non-linearity** to the model — which is essential, because without it, your neural network would just be a fancy **linear equation**.

---

## 🧠 Analogy

Think of a neuron like a **gate**:

* The input pushes on the gate.
* The activation function **controls how far the gate opens** based on the push.

## 🔑 Why Do We Need It?

Without activation functions:

* A neural network could only model **straight lines** (linear relationships).
* Real-world problems (like image recognition, language understanding) are **non-linear**.

## 🔷 Common Activation Functions

| Name           | Formula                         | Output Range   | Use Case Example                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Step**       | 0 if x < 0 else 1               | {0, 1}         | Perceptron (basic logic)                  |
| **Sigmoid**    | 1 / (1 + e^(-x))                | (0, 1)         | Binary classification                     |
| **Tanh**       | (e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x)) | (-1, 1)        | When output needs symmetry                |
| **ReLU**       | max(0, x)                       | \[0, ∞)        | Most common in deep learning              |
| **Leaky ReLU** | x if x > 0 else 0.01x           | (-∞, ∞)        | Helps fix "dead ReLU" problem             |
| **Softmax**    | e^xᵢ / Σe^xⱼ                    | \[0, 1], sum=1 | Multi-class classification (output layer) |

## 📈 Visual Intuition

* **Step Function** = Basic decision: yes or no
* **Sigmoid** = Smooth curve from 0 to 1
* **Tanh** = Like sigmoid, but outputs can be negative
* **ReLU** = Outputs 0 if input is negative, else same as input
* **Softmax** = Turns scores into probabilities that sum to 1

## 🧪 Example in Python

```python
import numpy as np

x = np.array([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2])

# Define ReLU
def relu(x):
    return np.maximum(0, x)

# Define Sigmoid
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

print("ReLU:", relu(x))
print("Sigmoid:", sigmoid(x))
```
