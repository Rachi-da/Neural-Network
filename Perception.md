The term you're asking about is likely **"Perceptron"** — a fundamental concept in neural networks.

Let’s break it down simply:

---

### 🧠 What Is a Perceptron?

A **perceptron** is the **simplest type of artificial neural network**, created in the 1950s by **Frank Rosenblatt**.

It simulates how a **single neuron** in the brain works.

---

### 🔶 Structure of a Perceptron

A perceptron:

* Takes **multiple inputs**
* Applies **weights** to those inputs
* Adds a **bias**
* Calculates a **weighted sum**
* Passes the result through an **activation function**
* Produces a **binary output** (0 or 1)

---

### 🔧 Perceptron Formula

```text
output = activation(w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + ... + wₙxₙ + bias)
```

* `x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ` = input values
* `w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ` = weights
* `bias` = a constant value
* `activation()` = usually a **step function** (outputs 1 if input > threshold, else 0)

---

### 🖼️ Example

Suppose you want to detect if a student will pass:

* **Inputs**:

  * x₁ = hours studied
  * x₂ = attendance %
* **Weights**:

  * w₁ = 0.6
  * w₂ = 0.4
* **Bias** = -0.5
* Output: 1 = pass, 0 = fail

---

### ✅ Important Notes

* A **single perceptron** can only solve **linearly separable problems** (like AND, OR).
* It **cannot** solve more complex tasks (like XOR) — for that, you need **multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs)**.

Excellent question! The **weights** like `w₁ = 0.6` and `w₂ = 0.4` in a perceptron are not fixed — they are **learned** during training.

Let’s explain this step by step:

---

### 🔶 How Are Weights Assigned?

#### 🟡 Step 1: **Initialize Randomly**

* At first, the weights are usually **assigned randomly** (e.g., `w₁ = 0.6`, `w₂ = 0.4`).
* The idea is to **start somewhere**, even if it’s wrong.

#### 🟡 Step 2: **Make a Prediction**

* The perceptron takes the inputs and computes the **weighted sum**:

  $$
  z = w₁ \cdot x₁ + w₂ \cdot x₂ + \text{bias}
  $$
* This is passed through the **activation function** to produce the **output**.

#### 🟡 Step 3: **Compare to Actual Output**

* If the prediction is wrong, the perceptron **adjusts the weights** to reduce the error.

---

### 🔧 Perceptron Learning Rule

If the output is incorrect, update each weight:

$$
w_i = w_i + \Delta w_i
$$

$$
\Delta w_i = \text{learning_rate} \cdot (y - \hat{y}) \cdot x_i
$$

Where:

* $y$ = true label (expected output)
* $\hat{y}$ = predicted output
* $x_i$ = input
* learning\_rate = small value like 0.01 or 0.1

📌 This formula **nudges** the weights in the direction that reduces the error.

### ✅ Summary:

| Step       | What Happens                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Initialize | Start with random weights                        |
| Predict    | Compute output using current weights             |
| Compare    | Calculate the error between predicted and actual |
| Update     | Adjust the weights to reduce the error           |
