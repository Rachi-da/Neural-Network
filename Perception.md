The term you're asking about is likely **"Perceptron"** ‚Äî a fundamental concept in neural networks.

Let‚Äôs break it down simply:

---

### üß† What Is a Perceptron?

A **perceptron** is the **simplest type of artificial neural network**, created in the 1950s by **Frank Rosenblatt**.

It simulates how a **single neuron** in the brain works.

### üî∂ Structure of a Perceptron

A perceptron:

* Takes **multiple inputs**
* Applies **weights** to those inputs
* Adds a **bias**
* Calculates a **weighted sum**
* Passes the result through an **activation function**
* Produces a **binary output** (0 or 1)

---

### üîß Perceptron Formula

```text
output = activation(w‚ÇÅx‚ÇÅ + w‚ÇÇx‚ÇÇ + ... + w‚Çôx‚Çô + bias)
```

* `x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, ..., x‚Çô` = input values
* `w‚ÇÅ, w‚ÇÇ, ..., w‚Çô` = weights
* `bias` = a constant value
* `activation()` = usually a **step function** (outputs 1 if input > threshold, else 0)

---

### üñºÔ∏è Example

Suppose you want to detect if a student will pass:

* **Inputs**:

  * x‚ÇÅ = hours studied
  * x‚ÇÇ = attendance %
* **Weights**:

  * w‚ÇÅ = 0.6
  * w‚ÇÇ = 0.4
* **Bias** = -0.5
* Output: 1 = pass, 0 = fail

---

### ‚úÖ Important Notes

* A **single perceptron** can only solve **linearly separable problems** (like AND, OR).
* It **cannot** solve more complex tasks (like XOR) ‚Äî for that, you need **multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs)**.
