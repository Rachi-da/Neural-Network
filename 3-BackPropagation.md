Excellent question!

### 🔁 What is **Backpropagation**?

**Backpropagation** (short for *backward propagation of errors*) is the **learning algorithm** used to train neural networks.
It **adjusts the weights and biases** by calculating how much each one contributed to the final error (loss).

### 🧠 Simple Analogy

Think of a student solving a math problem. If the answer is wrong, the teacher tells **where the mistake happened** (which step), and the student goes back to fix it.
Similarly, in a neural network:

1. You make a prediction (forward pass).
2. You calculate how wrong it was (loss).
3. You go **backwards**, layer by layer, adjusting each weight — that’s backpropagation.

### 🧮 Step-by-Step Process

Let’s say we have input $X$, prediction $\hat{y}$, and true label $y$.

1. **Forward Pass**:

   * Compute output: $\hat{y} = f(X; W)$
   * Compute loss (error): $L = \text{Loss}(y, \hat{y})$

2. **Backward Pass** (Backpropagation):

   * Use **chain rule** to compute how much each weight $W$ affected the loss
   * Calculate **partial derivatives**:

     $$
     \frac{\partial L}{\partial W_1}, \frac{\partial L}{\partial W_2}, \dots
     $$

3. **Update Weights**:

   * Using **gradient descent**:

     $$
     W := W - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial W}
     $$

     where $\eta$ is the **learning rate**

### 🔁 Why It’s Called “Back”-Propagation?

Because it works **from the output layer to the input layer**, updating weights **backwards**.

### 🔧 Tools It Uses:

* **Chain Rule** (from calculus)
* **Gradient Descent** (for optimization)
* **Loss function** (to measure error)
