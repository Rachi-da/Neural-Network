A **neuron** is a basic unit in both biological and artificial systems:

### üß† In Biology:

A **neuron** is a **nerve cell** in the brain and nervous system. It:

* **Receives signals** through **dendrites**
* **Processes** them in the **cell body**
* **Sends signals** to other neurons through the **axon**
* Communicates across gaps called **synapses**

Neurons are responsible for thinking, sensing, moving, and everything the brain does.

### ü§ñ In Artificial Intelligence (AI):

A **neuron** (also called a **node** or **unit**) is a part of an **artificial neural network**. It:

* **Takes input values** (like numbers)
* **Multiplies** them by **weights**
* **Adds** them together
* **Applies an activation function** to decide the output
* **Passes the result** to the next layer of the network

Artificial neurons help machines **learn from data**, just like biological neurons help us learn from experience.

Here's a simple explanation of that sentence:

**"Communicates across gaps called synapses"** means:

In the brain, **neurons don‚Äôt touch each other directly**.
Instead, there‚Äôs a **tiny gap** between them called a **synapse**.
When one neuron wants to send a message to another, it **releases chemicals (neurotransmitters)** into this gap.
These chemicals **carry the signal** across the synapse to the next neuron.

So, the **synapse** is the **bridge** where communication between neurons happens.

Great question! Let's clarify:

### üß† Is it the **axon** or the **synapse** that handles communication?

* The **axon** is the **long fiber** of a neuron that **carries the electrical signal away** from the cell body.

  * Think of it as the **delivery wire** that sends the message **toward** the next neuron.

* The **synapse** is the **tiny gap** between the **end of the axon** of one neuron and the **dendrite** of the next neuron.

  * It‚Äôs where the **actual transfer of the message** happens ‚Äî using **chemicals** (called **neurotransmitters**).

### ‚úÖ So:

* The **axon** **sends** the signal **to** the synapse.
* The **synapse** is the **bridge** that allows the signal to **reach** the next neuron.

üîÅ **In summary:**

* **Axon** = sends the message.
* **Synapse** = where the message **crosses over** to the next neuron.
