## ðŸ§  Neural Network Classification â€“ Lecture Notes

### ðŸ”¹ What is Classification?

Classification is the process where a neural network assigns an input (like an image) to one of several predefined categories (like "cat" or "parrot").

---

### ðŸ”¸ How It Works â€“ Step by Step:

1. **Feature Extraction**

   * Earlier layers (convolution + pooling) analyze the image and detect features like edges, textures, and patterns.
   * These features are turned into **activation values** (numbers between 0 and 1), which represent how strongly a certain pattern is present.

2. **Feature Activations**

   * These numbers (seen on the left of the diagram) are inputs to the next part of the network.
   * Some activations are **strong** (e.g., 0.96, 0.94), which means theyâ€™re highly relevant to identifying the object.

3. **Fully Connected Layer**

   * All activations are passed to a **dense layer** that connects them to each possible label (e.g., "cat", "parrot").
   * Each class gets a **score** based on how much the features support it.

4. **Prediction**

   * The class with the **highest score** is selected as the final output.
   * In the image, the score for "parrot" is **0.91**, which is higher than the score for "cat", so the model predicts **parrot**.

### âœ… Summary for Students:

> "A neural network uses the features it learned to compute scores for each possible category. The category with the highest score becomes the prediction."
